# VulpineSystem

**VulpineSystem** is a 64 bit fantasy computer based on the RISC-V architecture. It runs an extended/enhanced version of [**xv6**](https://github.com/VulpineSystem/xv6), a Unix-like operating system, and is intended to be used for learning operating system development skills.

The RISC-V emulation core is based on [semu](https://github.com/jserv/semu).

## Getting Started

### Building

Simply run `make`. The resulting binary will be saved as `vulpinesystem`.

### Usage

`./vulpinesystem <raw kernel image> [<disk image>]`

The most common use case is passing the [**xv6**](https://github.com/VulpineSystem/xv6) kernel image as the first argument, and the filesystem image as the second argument: `./vulpinesystem ../xv6/kernel/xv6 ../xv6/fs.img`
